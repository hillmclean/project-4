# Inhabitent WordPress Site  by Hillary

This site was built using mainly PHP and the content managment system, WordPress. It is a website for a "client" who owns a  "another hipster camping supply shop." 

## Technolgy Used
In this repo, you will find the following files:

HTML/PHP
CSS/Sass
JavaScript
JSON
Node Modules
WordPress Plugins
- Business Hours Widget
- Contact Form
- Contact Info Widget
- Inhabitent Functionality Plugin
- Social Info Widget

## Personal Learnings
In the making of this project, I have started to learn the following:

- How to use WordPress in the backend
- How to create plugins and widgets
- How to use WordPress functions
- How to use PHP

What I found the most challenging during this project was figuring out what goes where and trying to understand how everything connects to one another and in which files. This is definitely still something I need to get better at (among many other things as well). 

## Personal Reflection
This project sure demands a lot to be completed in such a sort amount of time and at times it was very stressful, but it is fun seeing  everything we have been learning come together and have those breakthrough moments. Dispite how messy my Sass/CSS is, I feel like I am becoming more confident in my skills and I am enjoying it.
